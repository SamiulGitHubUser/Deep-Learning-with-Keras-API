Basic of Kears and TensorFlow -API

## Data Preprocessing to Save & Load Model
Common steps of Artificial Neural Network(ANN)/DNN Architecture.
  * Data Preparation or Feature Engineering
  * Create an Artificial Neural Network(ANN)/DNN Model 
  * Train the Model
  * Build a Validation/Dev set
  * Evaluate the Model
  * Make Prediction
  * Improve the Model (if prediction is not enough)
  * Save the Model
  * Load model where necessary
